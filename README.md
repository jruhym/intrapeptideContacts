# intrapeptideContacts
Report on the intrapeptide hydrogen bonds, hydrophobic interactions, ionic interactions, and disulfide bonds using geometric (not quantum mechanical) calculations of atomic positions in a pdp file.
This is a work in progress. 
For the definition of a hydrogen bond, the algorithm of Stickle et al. J Mol Biol. 1992 Aug 20;226(4):1143-59 is used.
To run the unit test run 'go test'.
